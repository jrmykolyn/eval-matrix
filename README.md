### Notes

- This was hacked together for internal use.
- It was only tested in chrome
- It makes many presumptions that data is valid or will crash and burn
- Corners were cut in code quality, many things could be refactored to be more logical/efficient
- Yup, I used a super primative hash routing system. Couldn't be bothered to create something more robust.
